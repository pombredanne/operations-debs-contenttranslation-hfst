General
-------

This is an English morphological transducer.  It is meant for analysis, and
thus overgenerates by allowing a large number of prefixes and suffixes.  The
exceptions lexicon and parts of the main lexicon are based on WordNet 2.0
(see http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/license/).

The lexicon has been further expanded by including words appearing in the
British National Corpus (BNC).  The grammar itself is licensed under the Gnu
General Public License.  The BNC expansion is not available in src/ as we don't
have license to distribute, but a guide to producing something similar may be
found in https://kitwiki.csc.fi/twiki/bin/view/KitWiki/HfstApplicationTutorial?#Building_an_English_morphology_f .

Compilation
-----------

Requires the files lexicon.lex and exceptions.lex

Compiles with foma (http://foma.sourceforge.net):

foma -l english.script

This constructs the main transducer. Parsing is from bottom to top, i.e. the command "up <word>" will parse a verb, etc.

For usage as an analyzing tool, see hfst-english-installable/README.
