    HFST Langname-analyze and Langname-generate installer

This package installs HFST's Langname-language morphological transducers and
scripts.

As root, "make install" installs system-wide scripts under /usr/local/bin and
transducers under /usr/local/share/hfst. "make uninstall" does the reverse.

After installation, the scripts

        LANGNAME-analyze-words
and
	LANGNAME-generate-words
	
will perform analysis and generation by attempting to run, respectively,
hfst-tokenize and hfst-lookup. Those utilities are not included, they have
to be present on your system. HFST is available from
https://github.com/hfst/hfst.

The morphologies vary somewhat in their tagging
conventions. To find the right tags to give to the generation side,
you have to either reverse-engineer them from what you see from the analysis
side, or refer to the documentation of the morphology itself (which are
sourced from third parties, NOT developed by HFST).

The scripts use standard input and standard output for communication. When
used interactively, they wait for EOF (probably CTR+D on your keyboard) from
the user before doing anything.
