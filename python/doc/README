This directory contains documentation for hfst package in Doxygen format.
Run 'doxygen Doxyfile' to generate the documentation (it will be written in
directory html which is created when doxygen is run) and copy everything under
directory 'html' to HFST github repository (hfst.github.io/python/VERSION/, 
where VERSION is the version number of HFST, e.g. '3.12.2', or 'next_release'
for upcoming releases). The documentation will be visible on page
<https://hfst.github.io/python/VERSION/index.html>. Also remember to update
the redirection link in hfst.github.io/python/index.html to point to the
documentation of newest release.

Scripts doxy2swig.py and xml2docstrings.sh have been used for creating hfst
doxygen documentation semiautomatically from docstrings in ../docstrings.i,
../libhfst.py and __init__.py files in directory ../hfst/. Currently,
changes in documentation must be done twice (in 'hfst/python/doc/' as well as
in 'hfst/python/') so that they are visible both on github pages and in hfst
python package (via 'help' command).
